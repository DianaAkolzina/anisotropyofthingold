We used the WVASE ellipsometerto determine the elements of the Mueller matrix for each sample at various angles. This helped to determine that anisotropy is present in the samples due to their ultra thin nature.

WVASE is a commercially available ellipsometer that can measure the Mueller matrix coefficients of a sample. The instrument works by measuring the polarization state of light that is reflected off the sample at different angles of incidence and at different wavelengths.

In WVASE, the incident light is typically linearly polarized, and the polarization state of the reflected light is measured using a photoelastic modulator (PEM) and a polarizer. The PEM is used to modulate the polarization state of the reflected light, while the polarizer is used to analyze the polarization state of the light.

By measuring the amplitude and phase of the modulated signal at a range of angles and wavelengths, it is possible to calculate the Mueller matrix coefficients of the sample. This is done using a process called regression analysis, where the measured data is compared to a theoretical model of the sample's optical properties. The Mueller matrix coefficients are then calculated by fitting the data to the model using least squares regression.

Overall, ellipsometers like WVASE are powerful tools for characterizing the optical properties of thin films and surfaces, and can provide valuable information about the polarization properties of light that can be used in a range of applications, from materials science to biophysics.

The Mueller matrix off-diagonal elements, 12, 21, and 34, describe the cross-polarization or depolarization of light and represent the scattering behavior of the material, related to its anisotropic properties. If the elements 12 and 21 are both large and positive, it suggests that the sample preferentially scatters light in a direction perpendicular to the polarization state of the incident light. On the other hand, if the elements are small or negative, it suggests that the sample is less anisotropic and scatters light more uniformly in all directions.

Similarly, the element 34 describes the degree of circular polarization of the light after interacting with the material. If the element is large and positive, it suggests that the material has a high degree of circular birefringence, meaning that it can selectively rotate the polarization state of the light.
